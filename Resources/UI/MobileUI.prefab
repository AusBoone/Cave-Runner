# MobileUI.prefab
# 
# Placeholder prefab describing a simplified on-screen UI for mobile builds.
# Structure:
#  - Canvas (with TouchInputManager component)
#    - JumpButton (bigger size, anchors bottom left)
#    - SlideButton (bigger size, anchors bottom right)
#    - PauseButton (anchors top right)
# 
# Each button should invoke the following TouchInputManager events:
#  - JumpButton PointerDown -> OnJumpDown
#  - JumpButton PointerUp   -> OnJumpUp
#  - SlideButton PointerDown -> OnSlideDown
#  - SlideButton PointerUp   -> OnSlideUp
#  - PauseButton Click       -> OnPause
# 
# The layout intentionally uses large buttons and minimal graphics so
# smaller phone screens can be tapped easily. Replace this file with an
# actual Unity prefab when editing inside the Unity Editor.
