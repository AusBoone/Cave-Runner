// EnemyBehavior.cs
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AI controller for simple flying enemies that pursue a designated target.
// The original implementation searched the scene for a GameObject tagged
// "Player" during Start(), which was both fragile and performed an expensive
// lookup.  This revision exposes a public SetTarget method so spawners can
// explicitly provide the player Transform when enemies are created. Movement
// continues to use world coordinates so rotation does not influence the chase
// direction, preventing erratic paths for rotated enemies.
